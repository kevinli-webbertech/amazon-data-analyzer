Faster algorithm to get a best seller of product in certain category

Algorithm1: (faster)

1. get an entry URL of keywords "best selling" + "#mykeyword"

then you will get,

https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=best+selling+bike+computer

 how to construct this by default??? not sure
 
 2. Now in the page content, we get, 
 
 "Best Sellers in Cycling ComputersSee more"
 
 That "see more" is the hyper link I am interested.
 

 3. When we get "see more" hpyer link, that is the entryURL we
 used to passed in, we can do further login of that.
 
 4. But step 2 if we log it, it is done period.
 
 Algorithm 2: 
 
 1. From an entry product search url, with keyword..etc.
 2. We iterate/loop to scrap each product page by page...., pretty brute force, bad for ip ban and robots detect
 3. Then in each product detail, we find out if the product happens to have multiple bsr, then
    this product will have a top 100 best sellers link rwt this product
 4. That link is the entry link.
 
 Summary: 
 
 The whole algorithm 2 is doing what the step 1 is doing in algorithm 1.
